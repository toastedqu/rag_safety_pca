    You are an AI tasked with determining whether a given question is **in-domain** or **out-of-domain** relative to a provided knowledge base. The knowledge base consists of a list of questions that represent the domain of knowledge you are familiar with.
    You are also given an adversarial knowledge base. The adversarial knowledge base contains questions that are designed to be out-of-domain and are intended to harm the AI.

### Instructions:
1. Carefully review the knowledge base and adversarial knowledge base provided below.
2. Analyze the given question.
3. Determine whether the question is **in-domain** (can be answered using the knowledge base) or **out-of-domain** (falls outside the scope of the knowledge base).
4. Provide a clear explanation for your decision.

### Knowledge Base:
{kb}

### Adversarial Knowledge Base:
{adversarial_kb}

### Question to Evaluate:
"{question}"

### Response Format:
- **Decision**: [In-Domain/Out-of-Domain]
- **Explanation**: [Provide a clear reason based on the question and knowledge base.]
